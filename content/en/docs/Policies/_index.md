       Terrascan policies are written using the [Rego policy language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/). With each rego policy a JSON "rule" file is included which defines metadata for the policy. Policies included within Terrascan are stored in the [pkg/policies/opa/rego](https://github.com/accurics/terrascan/tree/master/pkg/policies/opa/rego) directory.
